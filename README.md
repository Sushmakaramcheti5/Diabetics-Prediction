# Diabetics Prediction System

## 📖 Project Overview
The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning–based application designed to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on key medical attributes. This project helps in early detection and supports healthcare decision-making using data-driven insights.

## 🎯 Objective
To build an accurate and efficient predictive model that classifies patients as diabetic or non-diabetic using historical medical data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Dataset
- Medical dataset containing features such as:
  - Glucose level
  - Blood pressure
  - BMI
  - Insulin
  - Age
- Dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize inputs.

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training
- Diabetes prediction based on input parameters
- Model performance evaluation using accuracy metrics

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (if applicable)

## 📈 Output
- Predicts whether a patient is **Diabetic (1)** or **Non-Diabetic (0)**
- Displays model accuracy and evaluation results
